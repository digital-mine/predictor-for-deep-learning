# Predictor For Deep Learning
A simple A.I. predictor written in python.

Please check out this repository that is propaedeutic to use this code https://github.com/digital-mine/classifier-for-deep-learning

This few lines code is a TEXT predictor that works with a 0,1 labeled classifier.
0 stand for FALSE and 1 for TRUE, it menas that the pice of text labeled with 0 is consider SPAM or POOR QUALITY.

The code itself is based on SKLEARN and on a CLASSIFIER previously created, and it analize new piece of text and LABEL them.

This code it COMPLETLY USLESS without a STRONG CLASSIFIER. 
The classifier gives the EXPERIENCE to the computer in order to let it learn how to takes autonomous decision, so please keep in our mind that the main point to develop a ROBUST A.I. is to build and use a BIG, SPECIFIC and HIGH QUALITY CLASSIFIER!
